            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my page! I go by Jayjay, I'm from Nigeria, but I grew up here in Baltimore Maryland.  
                enlisted in the navy straight out of high school, so i've currently served for 1 year now.  
                A fun fact about me is that I absolutely love Chipotle. Which is one of my favorite things.

                I'm a student currently majoring in Information Technology (IT) as part of my educational journey.
                I'm focused on learning the basics to build my career skills. As of right now, my tech skills are at a surface 
                level, but I'm working on improving them.

                Beyond my studies, I'm very passionate about true crime. I enjoy diving into documentaries, podcasts, and
